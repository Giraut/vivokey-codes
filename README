GTK authenticator to read TOTP codes from a Vivokey OTP applet, display them

https://github.com/Giraut/vivokey-manager



Installation
------------

1/ Install the Vivokey Manager command line utility. See:

   https://github.com/Giraut/vivokey-manager

   Optionally, you can install Vivokey Manager from a pre-build Debian package:

     - See https://github.com/Giraut/ppa to add the PPA repository to your
       APT sources

     sudo apt install vivokey-manager

2/ Copy vivokey_codes.py to /usr/bin/vivokey_codes
   Copy vivokey_codes.png into /usr/share/icons/
   Copy vivokey_codes.desktop into /etc/xdg/autostart/

   Optionally, you can also install everything from a pre-build Debian package:

     sudo apt install vivokey-codes



Usage
-----

   Go into your startup programs configuration and enable Vivokey Codes. Then
   log out and back in, or start the program immediately if your startup
   configuration allows it.

   This program starts minimized in the system tray. Click on the icon then
   select "Get codes" to start the authenticator's panel.

   As soon as the panel comes up, it starts polling the PC/SC reader whose name
   is specified in the Reader field for a Vivokey token to read. When the panel
   is closed, it stops polling the reader.

   Present your Vivokey token to the reader. If the token is passworded, you
   can set the password in the panel.

   If a token is read successfully, the accounts and associated TOTP codes it
   returned are displayed in the list. Select one entry to copy the code into
   the clipboard.
