                                 -------------
                                    v0.4.1


GTK authenticator to read TOTP codes from a Vivokey or Yubikey OTP applet,
display them and copy them into the clipboard.



Installation
------------

   Install the files as root:

     install -m 755 vivokey_codes.py /usr/bin/vivokey_codes
     install -m 644 vivokey_codes.png /usr/share/icons/
     install -m 644 vivokey_codes.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/
     install -m 644 vivokey_codes.desktop /usr/share/applications/

   Optionally, you can also install everything from a pre-build Debian package:

     sudo apt install vivokey-codes



Usage
-----

   Go into your startup programs configuration and enable Vivokey Codes. Then
   log out and back in, or start the program immediately if your startup
   configuration allows it.

   This program starts minimized in the system tray. Click on the icon then
   select "Get codes", or middle-click on the icon, to start the authenticator's
   panel.

   As soon as the panel comes up, it starts polling the PC/SC reader whose name
   is specified in the Reader field for a Vivokey or Yubikey NFC token to read.
   When the panel is closed, it stops polling the reader.

   Present your Vivokey or Yubikey NFC token to the reader. If the token is
   passworded, you can set the password in the panel.

   If a token is read successfully, the accounts and associated TOTP codes
   it returned are displayed in the list. If an account is a Steam account
   (i.e. the issuer is "Steam"), the TOTP code will be a 5-letter Steam code.

   Select one entry to copy the code into the clipboard. The code may be pasted
   into any application with right-click-paste, Ctrl-V or with the middle-click.

   If background reading is enabled, the authenticator's panel automatically
   appears upon successfully reading new codes.

   If close on select is enabled, the authenticator's panel automatically closes
   when a code is selected.
